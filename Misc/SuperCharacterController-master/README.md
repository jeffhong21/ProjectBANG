If you are searching for a robust Character Controller for Unity, I'd recommend the [Kinematic Character Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/kinematic-character-controller-99131) by Philippe St-Amand.

# SuperCharacterController

Custom Character Controller for Unity. Fulfills all common character controller functions such as collision detection and pushback, slope limiting and collider ignoring. New features include the ability to rotate the controller to any angle, ground detection, ability to clamp the character to surfaces, and detailed collision response messages. All functions are fully exposed and editable. Also includes the SuperStateMachine, a finite state machine designed to interact with the controller.

See development blog of the project here: https://roystanross.wordpress.com/
